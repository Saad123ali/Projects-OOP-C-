# C++ Vector-Based Projects

Welcome to my C++ projects repository! This collection includes two projects that use vectors for data management: a Vehicle Management System (VMS) and a Book Management System.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Vehicle Management System (VMS)**
   - **Description**: A system designed to manage vehicle information using vectors. It supports functionalities such as parking three types of vehicle like Bus, Car, Bike and with two types of parking like days and hours. It also calculate fine if parking time exceeded automatic and show realtime bill calculation also block vehilces if wrong token enter and admin also access to see all data and also add mini feature to hide the admin password.
   - **Technologies Used**: C++, Vectors

2. **Book Management System**
   - **Description**: A system for managing book records using vectors. Features include adding new books, removing existing ones, searching for books, and displaying the list of books.
   - **Technologies Used**: C++, Vectors
